                <h4><strong>Problem</strong></h4>
                <p>Despite the San Diego Zoo having their own app for navigating the zoo, 
                users reported it as cumbersome, and difficult to use. 
                The app is difficult to navigate and the directions it gives are difficult to follow, 
                leading some users to give up on using the app and instead choosing to use a paper map.</p>

                <h4><strong>Solution</strong></h4>
                <p>Our app, ZooSeeker, is a mobile app that allows users to plan their trip to the San Diego Zoo.
                    Users can search for animals, exhibits, and restaurants, and add them to their itinerary. 
                    The app will then generate a map of the zoo, with the user's itinerary highlighted. 
                    The app will also provide directions to the user's next destination, 
                    and will notify the user when they are close to their next destination.</p>

                <h4><strong>Software Development Process</strong></h4>
                <p>We followed the agile software process, creating user stories, BDD scenarios, 
                    as well as object-oriented design principles such as SRP, dependency inversion, and the open-closed principle. 
                    In addition, when applicable, we applied design patterns such as singleton, adapter, observer, etc.</p>

                <h4><strong></strong>Reflection</h4>
                <p>This project was my introduction into the world of agile software development. 
                    I learned a lot amount planning out iterations, working in groups, as well as when to pivot in order to have deliverables ready for each sprint.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My role varied according to the needs of our team, but I spent the most time as a project manager and lead tester for our project. 
                    These roles gave me some experience in communication as well as continuous integration and android testing frameworks like Espresso.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If I had more time, I would have spent more time on the user experience and design of this project. 
                    We didn't work on the user experience or user interface of this project in order to meet our mvp as well as implement all of our user stories. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, it may be a better idea to cut out less essential features and improve upon the user experience of the core features.
                    Users would care more about the app functional, with a good user experience, than a fully functional app with a bad user experience.
